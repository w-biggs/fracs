The old "Fast Decimals to Fractions" site seems to be down, but I used it a lot, so I've copied its source from the [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20180816152138/http://www.mindspring.com/~alanh/fracs.html) here & might work on improving it in the future.

The original source code states that at least the script portion is free:
> No license. Free to copy, and provided inline to make it easy to copy.
